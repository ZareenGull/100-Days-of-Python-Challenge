I am taking up an oath to learn Python from beginner to advanced for 100 days. This repository will be dedicated to keeping track of the progress I made along the way.
# Day 1

- What is Programming

- Features of Python
- What is Python used for?
- Installation of VS Code and setting up Python by downloading packages and extensions
